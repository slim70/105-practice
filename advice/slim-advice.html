        <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
        <p>Whenever you learn something new, you won't be able to see more than the single step ahead of you. You will have no clarity. None of it will make sense as a whole and you won't be able to see where you are going. That's ok. Move forward anyway. The way will eventually reveal itself and subparts will eventually fit into the entirety.</p>
        
        <h4>Have faith</h4>
        <p>Know that it will all make sense one day. Have faith that it will reveal itself and you won't be in the dark forever.</p>
        
        <h4>Keep moving forward</h4>
        <p>Momentum is the key to almost all accomplishment. So even when you're confused, keep pushing forward. Make a little bit of progress each day. Don't let the confusion and lack of clarity become so intimidating that you stop. Break things down into small chunks and focus only on getting the next little bit done. Congratulate yourself for each small step forward.</p>
