                <h4>Practice makes perfect!</h4>
                <p>Writing code may not be intuitive at first, but neither is riding a bike! With persistence and consistency, writing code to create will become second nature. The more code we write, the faster and more fluid it will become.</p>

                <h4>Create something for you.</h4>
                <p>While these are technical skills that we're learning, they are powerful creative tools as well. Building a website or portfolio that allows you to express yourself is a great way to feel connected to the skills you're learning, and serves as a great motivator to keep pushing forward!</p>
